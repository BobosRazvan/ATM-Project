## ATM
A FPGA board project, written in VHDL, which features fundamental components like
registers and counters to simulate the core functionalities of an ATM.
# Getting Started with Your ATM Project in Vivado, GitHub, and FPGA Board

## 1. Clone Your GitHub Repository
```bash
git clone <your_repository_url>
```
## 2. Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
Copy code
cd your_atm_project
```
## 3. Unzip the Project (If Necessary)

## 4. unzip your_atm_project.zip

## 5. Open Vivado Project
```bash
Copy code
vivado
```
In Vivado, open your ATM project. Use the "File" menu, then "Open Project" to navigate to your project directory and select the .xpr file.

## 6. Generate Bitstream
In Vivado, generate the bitstream for your ATM project.

## 7. Export Hardware
Export the hardware including the bitstream.

## 8. Connect FPGA Board
Connect your FPGA board to your computer. Ensure the FPGA board is powered and properly connected.

## 9. Program FPGA
Use Vivado to program the generated bitstream onto your connected FPGA board.

## 10. Run the ATM Project
Follow any specific instructions in your project documentation to run the ATM application on the FPGA board.

Additional Tips
Documentation: Check your project's README.md for any specific instructions or dependencies.
Drivers: Ensure that you have the necessary drivers installed for your FPGA board.
Vivado Version: Make sure you are using a compatible version of Vivado for your project.
This guide provides a general overview, and the steps may vary based on the specifics of your ATM project, the FPGA board you are using, and any project-specific requirements. Always refer to your project's documentation for the most accurate instructions.
