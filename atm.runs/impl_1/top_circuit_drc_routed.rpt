2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net l00/I0_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin l00/I0_reg_i_2/O, cell l00/I0_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net l00/I1_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin l00/I1_reg_i_1/O, cell l00/I1_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net l00/I2_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin l00/I2_reg_i_1/O, cell l00/I2_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net l00/I3_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin l00/I3_reg_i_1/O, cell l00/I3_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port JA[0] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#2 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port JA[1] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#3 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port JA[2] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#4 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port JA[3] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#5 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port JA[4] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#6 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port JA[5] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#7 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port JA[6] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#8 Warning
