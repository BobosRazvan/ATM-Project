LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell l17/memory[0][3]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) l7/memory_reg[0][0]/CLR, l7/memory_reg[0][1]/CLR, l7/memory_reg[0][2]/CLR, l7/memory_reg[0][3]/CLR, l7/memory_reg[1][0]/CLR, l7/memory_reg[1][1]/CLR, l7/memory_reg[1][2]/CLR, l7/memory_reg[1][3]/CLR, l7/memory_reg[2][0]/CLR, l7/memory_reg[2][1]/CLR, l7/memory_reg[2][2]/CLR, l7/memory_reg[2][3]/CLR, l7/memory_reg[3][0]/CLR, l7/memory_reg[3][1]/CLR, l7/memory_reg[3][2]/CLR (the first 15 of 16 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
